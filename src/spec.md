# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Convert the header logo and bike gallery cards to interactive 3D rendered elements using Three.js and React Three Fiber.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the header logo image with a 3D rendered circular winged emblem that rotates smoothly with metallic chrome appearance
- Replace static bike card images in the gallery with 3D motorcycle models that users can interact with by hovering or dragging
- Maintain all existing bike specifications, pricing, and responsive layout

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see an animated 3D logo in the header and can interact with 3D motorcycle models in the gallery by rotating them, while all bike information remains accessible.
